## Students’ Performance in Examinations – Statistical Analysis
MH3511 - Data Analysis with Computer (Group Project)

# Project Overview
This project analyzes the factors influencing students’ academic performance using a dataset of 500 students. The goal is to identify which demographic, behavioral, and academic variables 
are significantly associated with students’ final examination outcomes. Using rigorous statistical methods, we examined relationships between study habits, attendance, prior performance, family 
background, and final exam results to derive meaningful educational insights. This project was completed as part of MH3511 – Data Analysis in Computing.
